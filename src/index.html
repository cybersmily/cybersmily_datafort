              <h5>2024-08</h5>
              <p><strong>08-14</strong> - Fixed a bunch of mobile layout issues on the Cyberpunk 2020 character generator. Should look better on the screen. Still needs work for the mobile experience.</p>
              <p>NEW* - Combat Tracker now has PDF export of all the characters are Fast & Dirty layout. You can now print it out and bring it to your game or add to your notes.</p>
              <p>NEW* - Added a row on the armor table for the character generator and the combat tracker to all you to add cover SP to the calculation to help with figuring out how much protection you have. </p>
              <p>I'm still looking at other improvements and new utilities to add  to the site. Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
              <p><strong>08-10</strong> - Fixed several bugs with the Cyberpunk 2020 character generator PDF export,
                weapon data, NR Map (specifically orbitville map), bug with the datafort creator.</p>
              <p>The update to the site has been awhile. I am working on a couple of things for the site, new apps. Just
                need to finish them up.</p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>2024-01</h5>
              <p><strong>01-31</strong> - Fixed some bugs with the combat tracker for weapons and skills. Added an
                option in the random weapon generator to set the quantity to generate. Options should be sticky now.</p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
              <p><strong>01-05</strong> - It has been awhile. Real life and my TTRPG has distracted me quite a bit. I'm
                running 2 games and playing in 2. I think I overburdened myself. But on to this update.
                I fixed a few bugs throughout the site none more than the ones on the 2020 Combat Tracker. </p>
              <p>I have spent a bit of time refactoring/restyling the combat tracker to help improve it for your
                Cyberpunk 2020 games. </p>
              <p> I have include icons instead of text for a combatant's wounds and status (stunned or dead).
                I like it better than the plan text. </p>
              <p>
                I update the top navigator to tighten it up a bit for better accesibility on mobdile devices. </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of mobile devices, I specifically tried to make the experience better on them;
                Less scrolling, flyout combatant details, better layout of the fields in the details.
              </p>
              <p>Those Cyberpunk 2020 netrunners I have include the ports and output ports numbers to each of the decks.
                So now you can keep track of how many options you should be limited to. There is also some small styling
                changes. </p>
              <p>Character generator also had some bug fixes. Filtering on skills with just values now works. Fixed an
                issuw with gear input boxes. </p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>2023-07</h5>
              <p><strong>07-10</strong> - Quick update. I know it has been awhile since my last one and this isn't
                anything ground breaking. Just doing some small bug fixes to the character generator this time.</p>
              <p>Apologies for the long silence. IRL has been sucking up my friend time as I'm in 5 gaming groups now. I
                wanted to game more but didn't think I would get this much. I run Cyberpunk 2020 and Call of Cthulhu
                (Masks campaign). I play in a Traveller game, a IU game, and alternate between Battletech and X Wing
                now. In addition work has been sucking up a lot of time now as well.</p>
              <p>If you want to know about my Cyberpunk 2020 game, head over the <a
                  href='https://www.worldanvil.com/w/cybersmily-s-cyberpunk-2020-world-cybersmily'>my World Anvil
                  world</a>. It's a Highrider campaing to free O'Neil 2 from the tyranny of ESA. This has been a lot of
                work getting this done and keeping the campaign going.</p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>2023-01</h5>
              <p><strong>01-21</strong> - Another update to the site:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Character generator for Cyberpunk 2020 now as location sections for cyberware and gear. You can
                now organization both sections with locations or however else you want to use that field for.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Location sections coming with drag/drop between the locations to help move them about. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Cyberware lookup has changed on the character generator. It is to be more inline with the
                datalist selectors.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug with the random cyberware generator to avoid duplicates.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug with the armor typeahead function not saving the piece of armor.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* improved the vehicle section on the character generator as well with a typeahead lookup and
                some layout changes.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* improved the cyberdeck/program section on the character generator to have drag and drop
                programs into the cyberdeck. More work is needed on it.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug with the combat tracker in which clicking on Is Stunned reset the initiative of the
                opponent.</p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h5>2022-12</h5>
              <p><strong>12-28</strong> - Not much done other than a few bug fixes and some udpates to the data sheets.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Changing lookup lists in the Cyberpunk 2020 character generator.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add a Cyberpunk 2020 Referee screens/cheat sheets.</p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>2022-11</h5>
              <p><strong>11-21</strong> - A few things have been added:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add haggling calculator to the Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020 under the Lifestyle
                Section of the sheet. This will use rules from Wildside supplement.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* A bunch of other updates to the Character Generator, such as type ahead look up on several
                input fields, fly out menus instead of pop up dialogs, in settings add/remove sections on the character
                print out, and more.</p>
              <p>Till next time gatos.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>2022-10</h5>
              <p><strong>10-10</strong> - bug fixes and enhancements to the character generator for 2020:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add check box to show just the skills with points in them.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Armor section allows to either calculate the EV/Cost/Weight of a piece or allow the player to
                customize the values.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Bug fix on armor section too, the EV will not count different pieces of armor on different
                limbs as a different layer for EV. So if you have a left arm piece with SP 20 and a right arm with SP
                12, the EV won't see them as differnt layers for stacking purposes.</p>
              <p>Again, plugging Wisdom000 and my VOD cast: Tales from the Forlorn Dopes. Check it out live every

              <h5>2022-09</h5>
              <p><strong>09-25</strong> - Some bug fixes to end the month off:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Renaming option of blank Language, Exper, Martial Art skill failing.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Net Arch for CP Red not loading saved json files.</p>

                League and Hot Stuff areas if you have Streetdeal skill and a place to put generic contacts to the
                sheet.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Bug fix on Combat Tracker for Cyberpunk 2020. Issues with Armor. Now you can override the set
                limites on SP as well as edit armor in the tracker instead having to delete the piece and recreate.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Bug fix on Data List. Numbers weren't filtering properly. Also renamed More Guns to Edge of
                Sword Conversion. I also fixed some filtering problems there as well.</p>
              <p>That's it for this relase. Right now been fleshing out a highrider campaign for 2020. If you like to
                see my work head over to <a

              <p>&nbsp;* ACPA fixed a bug with notes not being retained after typing.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* ACPA has STR 18 chassis to choose. This is NOT cannon, but was requested.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* ACPA now can create WADs (Working Assistant Droi...*Disney edit* Drones) for you robot/drone
                lovers. This was a major overhaul of the ACPA code base. But I got it working.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* ACPA Generator you can load stock designs using the Search button. These includes most of the
                designs from the various sourcebooks.</p>

              <h5>2022-08</h5>
              <p><strong>08-28</strong> - A couple of fixes made to the site this time.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug with random armor not setting all the locations properly on the combat tracker and
                character generator for Cyberpunk 2020</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add program details to the Datafort Designer for Cyberpunk 2020 so that you don't need to fill
                them out after you randomly generate a fort.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add Drag/Drop funcationality to the Datafort Designer, so now you can drag the icons around and
                place them where you need to. There are still some glitches with it, but I would say it falls within the
                90/10 rule of functionality.</p>

              <p><strong>08-17</strong> - Not much going on with the site. Been concentrating on creating a Deep Space
                campaign centered around the O'Neil Two reovlt during the 4th Corporate war. That is an on going process
                as I flesh out the fluff in space.</p>
              <p>Here's a list of things I've done to the site so far this month:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a nasty bug in the NET Architect Generator for Cyberpunk Red. Switching a node type was
                deleting the parent nodes.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed issues with editing and adding skills in Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020. Should
                be a bit better on creating new skills. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add a new blueprint for a biotech research facility I used in my last campaign. Could still use
                some work, but quite detailed for a referee's needs.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add a revision of the orbital map from Deep Space pg 7. Had some feedback on making a bit more
                accurate.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Also I wrote a short story about one of my characters/NPCs, A Night to Remember. You can
                download under DLow section and take a read. Hope you enjoy it. Special thanks to my wife, the super
                editor.</p>

                <strong>07-17</strong> - The updates keep coming. This month
                we have bug fixes and some new stuff
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;* Master Vehicle List is now live. This contains all the
                RTG vehicles that are cannon with Cyberpunk 2020. Some of the
                attributes are blank as per the source. I am still debating on
                whether to keep them that way or update them to be more inline
                with Max Metal stats. Thanks to Ikarius over on
                <a href="https://discord.gg/Jhy9Txx5hP">Discord</a> for
                helping with this.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;* Character Generator Roles sections has been reworked,
                specifically on the skills. I remove the hard limit of
                selectable skills, change it to free for text box but will a
                hint displaying the skill that should be there as well as a
                type ahead search for adding skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;* Speaking of skills, the list has been update to be
                more inline with some other sources and removed redundancies.
                Thanks to Tekquest for assisting in the clean up.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;* Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020 also has
                improved the notes section. There were issues with performance
                when typing in that section, hopefully you will see some
                improvements there.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;* Updated some of the Max Metal metadata in the Max
                Metal Calculator. Added Cyberwalk type and updated some of the
                source pages on equipment.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;* Fixed a bug in the ACPA Generator for the PDF where
                internal slots were duplicated to the external ones.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Added a few new Peeps that were NPCs in my game.</p>
              <p>
                I am still working on the Character Generator for Cyberpunk
                Red. I am making progress, slow, but some. It will be coming
                and just takes time to get things the way I want them. I am
                enjoying all the feedback I am getting on the Cybersmily's
                Datafort Discord. There has been some great things coming from
                the community. It is helping me and this site a lot to hear it
                all. If you are interested, please click the Discord icon in
                the menu bar.
