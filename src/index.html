                <h5>2022-09</h5>
              <p><strong>09-17</strong> - Another release this month with the following:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* New Contacts section to the Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020. This includes the Big League and Hot Stuff areas if you have Streetdeal skill and a place to put generic contacts to the sheet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Bug fix on Combat Tracker for Cyberpunk 2020. Issues with Armor. Now you can override the set limites on SP as well as edit armor in the tracker instead having to delete the piece and recreate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Bug fix on Data List. Numbers weren't filtering properly. Also renamed More Guns to Edge of Sword Conversion. I also fixed some filtering problems there as well.</p>
        <p>That's it for this relase. Right now been fleshing out a highrider campaign for 2020. If you like to see my work head over to <a href='https://www.worldanvil.com/w/cybersmily-s-cyberpunk-2020-world-cybersmily'>my World Anvil site</a>. It contains some things from my previous campaing in Night City as well.</p>
        <p><strong>09-04</strong> - More goodness to the site. Worked on a few things so far:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* ACPA has custom weapon/component option to add to locations on the ACPA.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* ACPA fixed a bug when removing components/weapons from a location.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* ACPA fixed a bug with notes not being retained after typing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* ACPA has STR 18 chassis to choose. This is NOT cannon, but was requested.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* ACPA now can create WADs (Working Assistant Droi...*Disney edit* Drones) for you robot/drone lovers. This was a major overhaul of the ACPA code base. But I got it working.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* ACPA Generator you can load stock designs using the Search button. These includes most of the designs from the various sourcebooks.</p>
        <p>Again, coming join my Discord server. I welcome feedback and chat on Cyberpunk related topics. The link is in the menu above.</p>
        <p>Tales from the Forlorn Dopes pod/vod cast is going on. Wisdom 000 and I over on <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/cybernationuncensored'>Cybernation Uncensored twitch</a> channel every 1st and 3rd Wednesday of the month.

We ramble on about Cyberpunk 2020, Cyberpunk Red, Cyberpunk 2077 and other Cyberpunk genre media like movies, TV servies, comics, anime, etc. Come join us.

                <h5>2022-08</h5>
                  <p><strong>08-28</strong> - A couple of fixes made to the site this time.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug with random armor not setting all the locations properly on the combat tracker and character generator for Cyberpunk 2020</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;* Add program details to the Datafort Designer for Cyberpunk 2020 so that you don't need to fill them out after you randomly generate a fort.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;* Add Drag/Drop funcationality to the Datafort Designer, so now you can drag the icons around and place them where you need to. There are still some glitches with it, but I would say it falls within the 90/10 rule of functionality.</p>

        <p><strong>08-17</strong> - Not much going on with the site. Been concentrating on creating a Deep Space campaign centered around the O'Neil Two reovlt during the 4th Corporate war. That is an on going process as I flesh out the fluff in space.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of things I've done to the site so far this month:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a nasty bug in the NET Architect Generator for Cyberpunk Red. Switching a node type was deleting the parent nodes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Fixed issues with editing and adding skills in Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020. Should be a bit better on creating new skills. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Add a new blueprint for a biotech research facility I used in my last campaign. Could still use some work, but quite detailed for a referee's needs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Add a revision of the orbital map from Deep Space pg 7. Had some feedback on making a bit more accurate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;* Also I wrote a short story about one of my characters/NPCs, A Night to Remember. You can download under DLow section and take a read. Hope you enjoy it. Special thanks to my wife, the super editor.</p>

                  utility will create gangs using Ocelot's gang generation
                  system from back in the day. A shout out to Ocelot for
                  allowing me to get this built. The utlity will also generate a

                <p>
                  <strong>07-17</strong> - The updates keep coming. This month
                  we have bug fixes and some new stuff
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Master Vehicle List is now live. This contains all the
                  RTG vehicles that are cannon with Cyberpunk 2020. Some of the
                  attributes are blank as per the source. I am still debating on
                  whether to keep them that way or update them to be more inline
                  with Max Metal stats. Thanks to Ikarius over on
                  <a href="https://discord.gg/Jhy9Txx5hP">Discord</a> for
                  helping with this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Character Generator Roles sections has been reworked,
                  specifically on the skills. I remove the hard limit of
                  selectable skills, change it to free for text box but will a
                  hint displaying the skill that should be there as well as a
                  type ahead search for adding skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Speaking of skills, the list has been update to be
                  more inline with some other sources and removed redundancies.
                  Thanks to Tekquest for assisting in the clean up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020 also has
                  improved the notes section. There were issues with performance
                  when typing in that section, hopefully you will see some
                  improvements there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Updated some of the Max Metal metadata in the Max
                  Metal Calculator. Added Cyberwalk type and updated some of the
                  source pages on equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Fixed a bug in the ACPA Generator for the PDF where
                  internal slots were duplicated to the external ones.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;* Added a few new Peeps that were NPCs in my game.</p>
                <p>
                  I am still working on the Character Generator for Cyberpunk
                  Red. I am making progress, slow, but some. It will be coming
                  and just takes time to get things the way I want them. I am
                  enjoying all the feedback I am getting on the Cybersmily's
                  Datafort Discord. There has been some great things coming from
                  the community. It is helping me and this site a lot to hear it

            Most images have been made by me (with the help of my brother). Any
            photos (or images that look like photos) will be taken down if the
            proper person (the one whose photo it is) contacts me. I don't have
            their permission and would love to have it if they want to give it
            out.

            Any items that aren't copyrighted by the aforementioned companies
            are mine. Some of these ideas might be similar to others. I will bow
            to their claims as long as there is no harassment involved. I'm
            sorry that my telepathic abilities have not yet been mastered and I
            do not wish to be blamed for stealing another's ideas.
