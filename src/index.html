              <P><strong>04-25</strong> - A new app and more bug fixes:</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* Fixed some issues on CP2020 character generator for skills.</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* News Headline Generator app for both CP2020 and CP Red (look under Apps)</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* Updated CP 2020 Lifepath Generator with dice icons instead of text buttons</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* Integrated Interlock Unlimited stuff into CP2020 Lifepath sources/options (<a href='https://datafortress2020.com' target='_blank'>Datafortress 2020 IU</a>):</p>
              <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- African Sourcebook family background charts </p>

              <p><strong>04-17</strong> - Wow April has been productive for ths site. Donen some clean up on the
              site. Here's the list:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* behind the scenes code refactoring to make my life easier.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* updating the CP 2020 Character Generator with more instructions on how to use.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* updating the CP 2020 Character Generator armor section with an icon button instead of text
                button.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP 2020 Character Generator and Combat tracker had some rework on the weapon list. Now there
                are some settings for random rolls. You can chose the type, subtype, availability and exclusion of
                names.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP 2020 Combat tracker bug fixes (initiative on individual opponents not working, as well as
                some other minor ones.)</p>
              <p>So what's ahead? Looking to get the cyberware list into the combat tracker, add a randomizer for armor
                on both the character generator and combtat tracker, looking to enhance the Red NET architect tool a bit
                more, and a few other things (like standardize the menu icons for all apps).</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am thinking of creating some tutorial videos for the site in case the interface isn't as
                intuitive as I think it is. Would love to hear from all of you if this is a good idea or not.</p>
              <p><strong>04-10</strong> - Major update to the NET Arch generator for Cyberpunk Red. Here's the list:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Export to PNG format now.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add/Delete floors and branches. NOTE: Adding a new floor will always be a file, but you can
                change it after it is created. Also when adding floors manually there is no constraint to have multiple
                bottom levels. That is something that you need to manually keep track of.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Color configuration for the icons, borders, text, and can be done on individual floors.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Has the constraints for creating an arch (reroll programs/passwords, max controllers allowed,
                can't branch on first 2 floors, minimum of 3 floors...).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Specifies the program names now (doesn't have their all their detes, you need to look in the
                core book for them.).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Calculates the total cost (cost per floor and each floor value set).</p>
              <p>There is still a bunch of manually work to do done when you create your own, but this tool should help
                you</p>
              <p>There is a infrequent bug with rendering, but it isn't too bad all things considerd.</p>
              <p>I still have qutie a bit left to do (adding demons...). Still don't have a PDF button, but you can use
                Chrome/Edge to do a print as PDF. The page should be formatted to remove the non-related elements on the
                page.</p>
              <p><strong>04-01</strong> - Updated parts of the site that didn't adhere to the <a
                  href='https://rtalsoriangames.com/homebrew-content-policy/'>R Talsorian Hombrew Policy</a>.</p>
              <p>Combat Tracker - remove the stats pulled from the source books for the templates. Added generic gangers
                and security guards. More will be added in the future.</p>
              <p>Combat Zone Generator - summarized the entries a bit more and corrected some mispellings.</p>
              <p>In other News, Wisdom of <a href='https://datafortress2020.com'>Datafortress 2020</a> and I are doing a
                twitch show. We are aiming to do it every other week on the <a
                  href='https://www.twitch.tv/cyberpunkuncensored'>Cyberpunk Uncensored Twitch channel</a>. We currently
                are giving our review of Cyberpunk 2077, but more reviews and other topics will be talked about. We

              <h5>2020-12</h5>
              <p>
                <strong>02-21</strong> - Another month into 2021 when the 4th Corporate War starts heating up.
                However seems that everyone is freezing ;).
                This is another update to the site with 2 new things: Red Net Architect Generator and a bunch of news
                reports from WNS 7 News Force team over in Gigs.
              </p>
              <p>The Red Net Architect Generator will create a architect for you.
                This will be a base structure using the rules from Cyberpunk Red main book. I didn't add specific
                programs into some of the slot and allow you to fill in as needed.
                You can alter each node, save the architect and load it later.</p>
              <p>The WNS 7 News Reports are catching up on events in my campaign, which is gooing great.
                The team is on the hunt for an AI with the 4th corporate war as a backdrop.
              </p>
              <p>Lastly I just attended TotalCon this year viritually. I was able to get into 2 Red games, both GMed by
                RTG, one by J Gray and the other was Jay Parker. I had a great time in both. Kudos to them!</p>
              <p>Till next time.</p>

              <h5>2020-12</h5>
              <p><strong>12-01</strong> - Not much this month other than some bug fixes.
                I have the full system of Red now and will be looking to add some more apps in the next few months.
                There will be some limitations though as I have talked with RTG.
                The utilities I create will not have any published data in them, as per reqeust from RTG.
                This means they will be very generic and require a bit of data entry on the part of you.
                I will make sure to have the ability to save your work.
              </p>
              <p>Stay safe gatos. The dark future is upon us!</p>

              <h5>2020-11</h5>
              <p><strong>11-01</strong> - This month's update includes a fan request. The Scout1255 over on reddit had a
                request
                for a combat zone block generator. They asked and sounded like a great idea. The app will create a map
                of 3x4 blocks and list a description for each bulding with a key to use. It will also have a section to
                generator street objects to add to the scene. But wait, there's more! An event generator as well. This
                is nothing too fancy, but should help out with
                creating a neighborhood quickly for your game. Still need to working on getting a print button on it.
              </p>
              <p>Other things that I did was fixing some minor bugs and some behind the scenes logistics. Still waiting
                on my copy of the Red so I can pump out some utilities for the game.Cyberpunk 2077 is coming out this
                month too. I hope I will have time to get some more work done on the site, but I have a feeling my
                schedule might be sucked up with all that game play.</p>
              <p>Stay safe gatos. The dark future is upon us!</p>

            <div>
              <h5>2020-10</h5>
              <p><strong>10-07</strong> - Did some bug fixes. One enhancement is the stats section on the CP2020
                Character Generator and Combat Tracker. Now you have the ability to add different modifiers to the stat.
                I also added an Initiative field to the character generation. You can manage any initiative modifiers to
                it as well. The other thing you will notice is that the stats and wound sections are now the same in
                both the combat tracker and character generator.</p>
              <p><strong>10-01</strong> - Good news! After a long hiatus I have return to refereeing Cyberpunk 2020
                which I am excited about. It has been taking me a bit to get my creative muscles working again but the
                site will benefit.</p>
              <p>This month Cyberware gets some love. I have created another searchable master list for cyberware for
                your reference. Again, like most of the master lists, it goes off of canon material I own. Which isn't
                to shabby of a collection. I have also implemented this list and more functionallity on the Character
                Generator for adding cyberware to your character.</p>
              <p>Besides the cyberware updates. I have also added some random rolls for name, role, and stats to the
                CP2020 Character Generator. The sheet has more and more randomly generation. The PDF export on the sheet
                has some tweaks as well with the weapon note formatting and the cyberware name.</p>
              <p>Since my creative juices are flowing I have added a new item in the Peeps section, Gangs/Nomad Packs. I
                added a few new gangs that will be making appearances in my game as well as a nomad pack. I also added
                some more NPCs as well.</p>
              <p>Last thing added is to the DLow section. I created some blueprints of my vision of The Night Owl
                nightclub, NCART train, and the NCART stations.</p>
              <p>Cyberpunk Red I hope is just around the corner. When it hits the street, I hope to add in more
                utilities for it to the site. First app I will be adding is a converter for CP2020 to CPRed. There are a
                few other apps I have ideas for, but until I have the full ruleset I really don't want to start working
                on the code.</p>
              <p>Stay safe gatos. The dark future is upon us!</p>

            <div>
              <h5>2020-09</h5>
              <p>
                <strong>09-01</strong> - Several things have been aded to the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                1st we have the master weapons list. This is a searchable list of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons for all
                cannon sources for 2020 (no cybergeneration i'm afraid). This list will give you the base stats for the
                weapons, but won't go into the finer details about the weapon. For that you need to go to the source,
                which I list and the page in the source book you can find it on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly I did an overhaul of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons sections in the combat tracker and character
                generator.
                I made the sections consistent with each other.
                Also, I have added *drum roll* a ammo tracker on the weapons in both areas.
                This includes an ammo tracker in the PDF version of the character sheet as well.
                Though there might be some formatting issues in the PDF if the weapon list is long and/or the weapon has
                a lot of shots.
                Let me know if there is a bug and I will try to figure out a solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other improvements include the combat calculator section in the combat tracker.
                It is by no means perfect, there is still more tweaking and special rules need to be added, but I hope
                it is a tool closer to your needs.
                I can enable this same calculator on the Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator as well. Let me know if
                you'd like to see that added.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cyberpunk Red Lifepath generator got some love this month as well.
                I switched out the text buttons to be icons (keeping consistent with the newer apps to the site),
                formatted the table to be red, and created a PDF button to generate the lifepath in a one page PDF (with
                the style of red).
              </p>
              <p>Again, if there are any bugs or ideas for enhancements let me know and I will try to get them resolved.

              <p><strong>08-21</strong> - Very embarassing. I tweaked the name generator however there was a bad bug in
                it. I'm sorry for those who suffered with a character named Undefined...</p>
              <p><strong>08-09</strong> - Did some bug fixes on the Combat Tracker thanks to Pawook over on the
                Cyberpunk 2020/RED Fans discord.
                The fixes are with the weapn, skill, cyber, and gear tabs when adding new items they get sticky.
                Added the BOD damage modifier to melee weapon damage rolls. Fixed the WA not being shown in the to-hit
                roll.
                Change the text for dice rolls and fixed an issue with the + modifier to damage dice.</p>
              <p><strong>08-01</strong> - - I change the menu a bit to turn it into a megamenu, which should space it
                out a bit more to help with using the menu on longer list of choices.</p>
              <p>A new app has been added: Cyberpunk 2020 Netrunner Deck Manager utility. This app allows you to
                create/enter a cyberdeck and programs for it.
                It keeps track of the costs as well as how many programs you have loaded into the deck.</p>
              <p>There are also some bug fixes with the combat tracker.
                Sorry about those, I should have caught them through testing. But the tracker shoudl be working better
                now.
                I have some addtional ideas for the tracker to help with doing combat, like choosing rounds to fire
                (including full auto/3rd burst). As well as a few other items.</p>
              <p>I have also added a link to the Github repository for the site. You can visit it and also log bugs and
                feature requests for enhancing the site.</p>

                <strong>07-01</strong> - You will notice I have split out Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk Red into 2
                different menu items. I am adding more and more apps, I want to categorize them as need. This month I
                add another CP 2020 app. This time a simple one for doing pharmaceuticals, Drug Lab.
              </p>
              <p>The covert roles from <a href="https://talsorianstore.com/products/firestorm-stormfront">Firestrom:
                  Stormfront</a> have been added to the role list and the character generator as well. There is still
                some work needed for the min skill values that the roles have. In time they will come.</p>
              <p>Added some more links to the LDL. All of them are for Youtube channels/playlists that have Cyberpunk
                2020/red content. Check these out!</p>
              <p>Last month we saw the launch of Night City Wire episode 1. Holy Saint Pondsmith, does CP 2077 look

                CP2020 app.
                This was a challenge to make sure it was client side only. Still working on a couple of new apps for the
                upcoming months.
                Half way through the year and continuing my goal of a new app or feature per month of 2020.
              </p>
              <p><strong>06-01</strong> Fixed a bunch of bugs. Added an armor management contorls for the Cyberpunk 2020
                combat tracker and character generator.</p>
              <p>Added a function in the Combat Tracker to import a CP 2020 Character file and add it as an opppenent.

              <p>05-09 - Quick update with fixes for some the apps.
                Been working on creating better unit tests to help with preventing some of the silly bugs I have done in
                the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help with this I have uploaded the code to Github (github.com/cybersmily/cybersmily_datafort/).
                This is also in prosperity just in case happens this old chromer ;-)
                I am also creating a wiki there for instructions on some of the apps. This is a work in progress.
                You can also log any issues/bugs/enhancements you have with the site.
              </p>
              <p>Bug fixes:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Fixer Calculator - Hot Stuff area rolls weren't loading and message if new area
                costs too much.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Combat Tracker - flagging skill rolls if they are a fumble or crit.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Character Generator - Loading character the saves are set to 0.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Max Metal Builder - Several issues, for the error popup, to option spaces not being
                tallied, and several other issues</p>
              <p>05-01 - Day 6,732 since lockdown...</p>
              <p>The good news is 2 new apps have been added this month: CP 2020 Combat Tracker and the Fixer
                Network/Contact Point calculator.</p>
              <p>Had to make some changes to the code to streamline it for integration with the combat tracker. Since
                needs more tweaks and enhancements. But will get to that in coming months. For now you should be able to
                play around with it</p>
              <p>The Fixer Contact Calculator uses the 2 systems (Hot Stuff and Big League) from Wildside supplement.
                You can save them as text files. Someday may integrate with the character genereator. </p>
              <p>The other HUGE app is the Combat Tracker. This has be really fun to make and it is no where near
                completed. There is mising functionality I have yet to implement (looking at you Armor section). There
                is also tons of tweaks I still want to do throughout it.</p>
              <p>For now it is done. Not done done. Just done. I hope it is useful. If it is and you have some ideas, by
                all means email me (uppper right on menu bar).</p>
              <p>In the coming months, working master lists for cyberware and weapons. These will not be as thorough as
                Datafortress 2020, go to his site and look up Ultrachrome. Mine will be from references within my own
                library of books, which is limited to the main cp2020 books and supllements and Inteface magazine.</p>
              <p>I will also be tweaking other parts of the site and apps as my fancy leads me or if there are any bugs
                reported by ya'll</p>

                most of my time.</p>
              <p>4/6 - Fixed/added some tweaks to Cyberpunk 2020 Character generator. Add input for number of years in
                lifepath. Added note field for weapons. Fixed the skill point calculation and the Special Abilty missing

              <h5>2020-03-28</h5>
              <p>More changes have arrived! There has been a few things I have change, from updating the javascript
                framework I have been using, to 2 new sections under Data, and updates to the CP2020 Character Sheet.
              </p>
              <p>The framework change was a minor, but had to untangle somethings to make it easier for future releases.
              </p>
              <p>The 2 new sections under Data are the Master Roles List and the Master Skills List.
                These contain most of the roles and skills I could find in the books I have in my library.
                I'm sure there are more and some entries I've missed.
                I also changed some of the Roles and skills to fit in line with others to keep them standardized.</p>
              <p>The update to the character genarator/sheet was to include all the roles from the master list and added
                a couple of skills.
                I didn't add all the skills, due to formatting issues, but roles that have skills not listed will add
                them to the Others section of skills.
              </p>
              <p>In additional, I have added click-to-roll on skills and saves.</p>
              <p>In the works: Continue adding bits and pieces to other apps in the site and creating a combat tracker
                to help with game play.</p>
              <p>I plan to a Cyberpunk Red character sheet, but am waiting for it to come out first. I have a feeling
                that the Jumpstart Kit is a simple version and it will be more elaborate with the full version.</p>
              <p>If you spot a bug, typo, or missing data, please send me an email. Click on the envelope icon in the

              <h5>2020-03</h5>
              <p>This month's updates are round character generation. I have add 2 apps: Cyberpunk Red Template
                Generator and the Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator.</p>
              <p>Cyberpunk Red Template Generator</p>
              <p>This will generate a random character based on the templates from the CP Red Jumpstart Kit. You can
                print the sheet straight form the browser. The intent is these are throw away characters, like the
                pregen from the kit.</p>
              <p>Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator</p>
              <p>This is a character online character sheet.
                It has more capabilities than the CPRJK generator and is based on the CP 2020 character sheet.
                The intent is to have a double-sided sheet to print.</p>
              <p>
                You can save the character to your local drive and load it back to the site to continue maintaining your
                character.
                There is some sticky data as well, so the data will stay if you come back to the site.
                But if you clear your cache or some other clearing of data in the browser will lose all that work, so
                save to a file when you end your session just in case.</p>
              <p>The CPRJK is as is. CP2020 I will be continue to work on.
                I plan to continue to build out the functionality. That will be scheduled for upcoming months.
                Right now I have another utility for CP 2020 in the works as well as getting ready for Cyberpunk Red and
                Cyberpunk 2077.
              </p>
              <p>I hope I can keep this pace up with an update per month this year. We will see what real life and what
                happens with how much CP 2077 takes up my free time. Till next time, burn that chrome!</p>

                This isn't a promise, just a goal.</p>
              <p>For this month's installment, I fixed a bug with the Fashion Calculator around some of the modifier
                would linger when changing the clothes.</p>
              <p>There has been a major update with the Max Metal App. I have added weapon/option selection. This is far
                from finished, so you shoudl audit your work with the book. I will continue to get some more fixes to
                it. But for now, you can play more with it.</p>
              <p>Also, you can save your Max Metal Vehicle to a text file now too!</p>
