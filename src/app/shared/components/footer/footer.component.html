      (or images that look like photos) will be taken down if the proper person
      (the one whose photo it is) contacts me. I don't have their permission and
      would love to have it if they want to give it out.

      You will see a bunch of links in this site to R. Talsorian Games and Drive
      Thru RPG. I do not get paid from either of these companies to do
      advertizing or adding these links. These links are to help you purchase
      the original game material that this site basis its content off of. Spend
      money to buy the game material. Support these companies. Without either,
      Cyberpunk 2020/Red wouldn't exist or continue to exist. Thank you for
      supporting these companies and my site.
