  This is an unofficial utility to create a Cyberpunk 2020 character.
  Here you will be able to create, save, load, and print character sheets.
  There is still a bit of work to be done, but this should help with starting out with the basics.
</div>
<div>
  This also allows the ability to create Interlock Unlimited characters as well. Go into the settings to change it.

  <h5>MENU</h5>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
      <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faSave"></fa-icon> SAVE - this will save a text file with the character in
      JSON format. JSON is used to hold the data of the character to be uploaded later to this utility. The JSON is not
      quite legilble by normal people, so don't assume you can pass this file off to others. Save this a a PDF and share
      that with others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faUpload"></fa-icon> UPLOAD - click here and upload the file from the SAVE
      step. This will take the JSON data and use it to fill in the sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faUndo"></fa-icon> RESET - This will reset the sheet to all blank values.
      Make to save before doing this to the txt(JSON) file first if you want to keep the character.
    </li>
    <li>
      <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faFilePdf"></fa-icon> SAVE AS PDF - This will save the character sheet as a
      PDF. This cannot be uploaded back to the sheet, so if you don't click SAVE button, then the data will need to be
      re-entered again.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h6>HANDLE</h6>
  <p>Enter a name or have one randomly generated.</p>
  <h6>ROLE</h6>
  <p>This contains all of the published roles within Cyberpunk 2020. You can select one or randomly roll one. Once chosen,
  the speical ability for that role will appear in the skill section as well as all role skills being highlighted and

  <p>The primary role can be randomly rolled by clicking <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faDice"></fa-icon>.
    This will randomly generate and set the primary role</p>
  <p>Setting the Primary and Secondary roles can be added through the editor by clicking on the <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faPen"></fa-icon>.
    This will open a popup to change the skills associated with the role. You will also need to set the skills with options as well.
  </p>
  <h6>CHARACTER POINTS</h6>
  <p>This box has the total number of character points for stats. If the stat total is different, a number will appear next
  to this box showing the different (black under, red over). You can also generate the Character Points by clicking
  <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn" [icon]="faDice"></fa-icon> icon which will also display the dice numbers to the right.
    </p>
  <h6>STATS</h6>
  <p>This is all the various stats and secondary stats. Rolling here will take the value from the CHARACTER POINTS and
  distribute them points randomly to each of the stats. Clicking on the stat will allow you to modify the base value and
  add modifiers (say from cyberware) to the stat. The stat have a format of #/#. The number on the left is for the base
  stat. Number on the right is the modified. Wounds will also apply modifiers as well. This will mark the stat in red.
</p>
  <h6>INITIATIVE</h6>
  <p>This box is for rolling initiative. Again you can add modifiers to the value to roll it.</p>
  <h6>ARMOR</h6>
  This section displays the SP values of armor for the character. Click on <fa-icon class="csd-icon-btn"
    [icon]="faShieldAlt"></fa-icon> icon to add/edit/remove armor layers.
  <h6>MANAGE ARMOR</h6>
  This will open a dialog box to manager the character's armor. Simply add a name for it, the SP values in each
  location, the EV, and if it is hard armor or skinweave. Once added, check it off to say that it is being used. The 3
  layer rule is implemented as well as the EV calculation as per rulebook.
  <br>"There's a character profile box but I can't add an image. Why?" Well here's the rub. My site doesn't have a data
  store in the back end (I'm cheap). Which means if you have an image it would be a link to an image out on the
  interwebs. Now the issue is if you reference an image you don't own, my site will get dinged for it and lawsuits can
  come my way. That is why it's uneditable.
